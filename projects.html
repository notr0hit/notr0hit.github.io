              In this project, I used the WISDM dataset to train a deep learning
              model to recognize human activities from accelerometer data. The
              goal was to accurately identify six activities: Walking, Jogging,
              Sitting, Standing, Upstairs, and Downstairs. I used LSTM neural
              networks and trained the model using the Keras library. To improve
              the model's performance, I preprocessed the data by segmenting it
              into fixed-size windows and standardizing the features using the
              StandardScaler. After training the model, I evaluated its
              performance using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics. The model
              achieved an accuracy of 97%, indicating that it was successful in
              recognizing human activities from accelerometer data.

              This tool can be useful for anyone who wants to quickly get a
              summary of a long article. I developed Project tool using Python's
              libraries like Tkinter, nltk, newspaper, and pyttsx3. The Article
              Summarizer tool extracts and parses newspaper articles using
              advanced algorithms with web scraping to extract all the useful
              text from a website.The GUI of this tool is created using Tkinter,
              the standard GUI library for Python. The user has to input the URL
              of the article that they want to summarize, and then they can
              click the "Summarize" button to get the summary of the article.
              The summary is displayed on the GUI in a text box. The tool also
              provides a "Listen to Summary" button that converts the summary
              text to speech.

              strategies like filtering candidate words based on frequency of
              letters, frequency of words using map and set data structures. The
              program uses multiple helper functions to check if a word or
              response is valid, to generate the best guess and filter the
              candidate words.
